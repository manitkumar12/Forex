Although tweezers are signs of a potential reversal, an ideal application for placing an entry order is when a tweezer has developed at the competition of a short-term correction of a longer-term trend. Reason being, trading with the overall trend will typically lead to greater potential for reward, thus more favorable risk to reward ratio. What is important to remember is tweezers do not indicate how long or far the potential reversal will last. Predetermined support and resistance levels should be determined in order to gauge risk vs. reward.\n" +
